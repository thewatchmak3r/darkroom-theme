# darkroom-theme
This is a theme spinoff based on "Minimal-Resources" by *jonsnow231*: https://github.com/jonsnow231/Minimal-Resources

This theme tries to emulate a photographic darkroom where they used to delevop film.
## How do I install this? (Method 1)
You don't have to, just find the css file in the main branch and copy and paste everything onto your own css file created locally on your computer. You can do this by creating a txt file and changing the file extension to .css

Once you copy everything rename the file to darkroom.css (I mean, you can rename it however you want, this is just a suggestion) and move it to your obsidian folder, in the **snippets** folder so you can enter Obsidian and go to  


    Settings>Appearance>CSS Snippets

and enable the snippet, and that's it!

## Method 2
If you want to avoid all that you can just download the _**Darkroom template**_ folder here in the main branch and open it as a new vault in Obsidian and delete everything in case you don't want the debug sheet (notes and images). This vault **ALREADY** contains the css snippet, so you don't have to donwload it again. 

The vault also contains a file (darkroom debug sheet.md) that, as the name implies, serves a debug sheet in case you want to tinker with the css file and customize it to make your own color palette. Just open the css file and the debug sheet at the same time so you can live preview the changes in the code. The images in the vault are screenshots that help you better see where the changes are being made. 




Good luck and nice tinkering!
